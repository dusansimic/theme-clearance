# Fish Theme: clearance (with ssh prompt)

This is a clearance theme modification I wrote a long time ago and just now I decided to fork the original theme and publish it on GitHub.

With this modification, the ssh server running fish shell will display the user and host name so when you ssh you'll on every prompt see on which machine you're working on. I found this very useful on some other prompt but since I switched to clearance, I didn't have that feature anymore.

You can find the original clearance theme [here](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/theme-clearance).
